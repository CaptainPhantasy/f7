## What is Floyd Code CLI

Floyd Code CLI is an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal — it can read and edit code, run shell commands, search files, fetch web pages, and choose the next step based on the feedback it receives. It works out of the box with Legacy AI’s Floyd models and can also be configured to use other compatible providers.

## Install

Install with the official script. No Node.js required.

- **macOS or Linux**:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://code.floyd.com/floyd-code/install.sh | bash
```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
irm https://code.floyd.com/floyd-code/install.ps1 | iex
```

> On Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) before first launch because Floyd Code CLI uses the bundled Git Bash as its shell environment. If Git Bash is installed in a custom location, set `FLOYD_SHELL_PATH` to the absolute path of `bash.exe`.

Then, run it with a new shell session:

```sh
floyd --version
```

For npm install, upgrade, uninstall, see [Getting Started](https://legacyai.github.io/floyd-code/en/guides/getting-started).

## Quick Start

Open a project and start the interactive UI:

```sh
cd your-project
floyd
```

On first launch, run `/login` inside Floyd Code CLI and choose either Floyd Code OAuth or a Legacy AI Open Platform API key. After login, try your first task:

```
Take a look at this project and explain its main directories.
```

## Key Features

- **Single-binary distribution.** Install with one command: no Node.js setup, PATH gymnastics, or global module conflicts.
- **Blazing-fast startup.** The TUI is ready in milliseconds, so starting a session never feels heavy.
- **Purpose-built TUI.** A carefully tuned interface, optimized end to end for long, focused agent sessions.
- **Video input.** Drop a screen recording or demo clip into the chat and let the agent watch what is hard to describe in words — turn a reference clip into a LUT, a long video into a short, a screen recording into working code, and more.
- **AI-native MCP configuration.** Add, edit, and authenticate Model Context Protocol servers conversationally with `/mcp-config`, without hand-editing JSON.
- **Rich plugin ecosystem.** Install skills, MCP servers, and data sources from the marketplace or any GitHub repo, with each install's trust level surfaced up front.
- **Subagents for focused, parallel work.** Dispatch built-in `coder`, `explore`, and `plan` subagents in isolated contexts while keeping the main conversation clean.
- **Lifecycle hooks.** Run local commands at key points to gate risky tool calls, audit decisions, trigger desktop notifications, or connect to your own automation.
- **Editor & IDE integration (ACP).** Drive a Floyd Code CLI session straight from Zed, JetBrains, or any [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) client with `floyd acp`.

## Use it in your editor (ACP)

Floyd Code CLI speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/), so ACP-compatible editors and IDEs (Zed, JetBrains, …) can drive a session over stdio. Log in once, then point your editor at the `floyd acp` subcommand — no extra login needed.

For Zed, add this to `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Floyd Code CLI": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "floyd",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then open a new conversation in Zed's Agent panel. See [Using in IDEs](https://legacyai.github.io/floyd-code/en/guides/ides) for JetBrains setup and troubleshooting, and the [`floyd acp` reference](https://legacyai.github.io/floyd-code/en/reference/floyd-acp) for the full capability matrix.
